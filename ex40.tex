\chapter{Exercise 40: Binary Trees}

Now that we've taken a break to focus on strings, I'll teach you the last
major data struct you should know.

The binary tree is the simplest tree based data structure and while it has been replaced
by Hash Maps in many languages is still useful for many applications.  Variants on the
binary tree exist for very useful things like database indexes, search algorithm structures,
and even graphics processing.

This exercise will create a simple binary tree and then discuss a few variants.
