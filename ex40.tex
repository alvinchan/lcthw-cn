\chapter{Exercise 40: Stacks}

I now get into more complex data structures and algorithms you can make with just the ones
covered so far.  Some of these will be variantions on other data structures that give new
algorithms.  Others will just be combinations of two data structures to implement a new
kind with useful properties.

This exercise will introduce the stack, and implement it with the dynamic array type.
