\chapter{Exercise 36: Safer Strings}

In this exercise we make a miniature version of the better string (bstring) library 
you've previously used.  This version of the library has the majority of the 
functions you'll use from bstring and mostly copies its API.

The purpose of this exercise is to finally teach you why C strings are bad,
and how to fix them.
