\chapter{Exercise 42: Stacks and Queues}

Stacks are used usually in processing tree-like data.  They are heavily used
in computer architectures (function calls use stacks), parsing, and anything
that involves reordering information and collapsing it.

Queues are useful for anything involving communication between parts in an ordered fashion.
This exercise will implement a basic queue using a linked list.
