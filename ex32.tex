\chapter{Exercise 32: Double Linked Lists}

I now get into teaching you the fundamental data structures that every programmer should
know, and that you usually need to use in C.  Other languages have many of these data structures
for "free" so you don't ever need to learn them.  C however has none of these, so you'll
need to implement your own or use libraries that have them.

This exercise you'll learn about the simplest data structure called a "linked list".  Actually
the one you'll make is a double linked list, and you'll learn the difference between the two
as you go.

I'll also be teaching you these data structures by having you create a library of them and 
have you write unit tests with our testing frame work.  The goal at the end is to have a 
little library of simple data structures and algorithms to work with that you know work 
because you've tested them.
