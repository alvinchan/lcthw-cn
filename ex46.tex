\chapter{Exercise 46: Suffix Arrays}

A suffix array is a nothing more than a heap sorted list of all the suffices in a string.  They are
very handy for finding sub-sequences in strings based on other strings and are used in things like
searching for genomic similarities.  A suffix array is also a very simple algorithm to implement
in a naive form.

This exercise will make a very simple suffix array to play with in the next exercise.
