\chapter{Exercise 43: Stack and Queue Algorithms}

Stacks are used usually in processing tree-like data.  They are heavily used
in computer architectures (function calls use stacks), parsing, and anything
that involves reordering information and collapsing it.  In this exercise
you are going to implement a simple calculator using a stack.

Queues are useful for anything involving communication between parts in an
ordered fashion.  You find them in almost every form of concurrency and
every network communication system.  In this exercise, you'll implement
a simple data structure called a \ident{Channel} that allows multiple
readers to receive data from one writer.

I'm also going to make you do it based on a test I give you.  You are to make
each of these tests run without any \program{valgrind} errors.
