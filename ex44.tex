\chapter{Exercise 44: Ring Buffer}

Ring buffers are incredibly useful when processing asynchronous IO.  They allow one side
to receive data in random intervals of random sizes, but feed cohesive chunks to another
side in set sizes or intervals.

This will implement a simple naive variant of a ring buffer, and then have a test driven
exercise to make a real complete ring buffer.
